        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Sisig originated from Pampanga. This place is considered as the culinary 
            capital of the Philippines. It was invented by Lucia Cunanan. She is 
            popularly known as Aling Lucing and the Sisig queen.

            The US military bases located in the town might have played a role in the 
            invention of this dish. People can buy cheap pig heads in commissaries 
            because these are not normally consumed inside the base. Meat from the 
            pig heads are scraped out, boiled, grilled, and made into what is now 
            known as Sisig
